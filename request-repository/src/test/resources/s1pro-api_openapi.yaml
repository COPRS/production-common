      ## Changelog
      ### V1.0.0
      - initial version
      ### V1.0.1
      - added usage notes section
      ### V1.0.2
      - put s1pro-api-svc as server/service name instead of localhost
      ### V1.2.0
      - minor editorial changes
      - changed type of `id` from UUID-string to long to match implementation in MQI persistence
      - added validation API `/validate`
      - added batch method for delete of FailledProcessings `POST /failedProcessings/delete`
      - added batch method for restart of FailledProcessings `POST /failedProcessings/restart`
      - changed `ApiRespones` Schema (used as a return for void and batch methods) to provide
        - entity-type targetet by the batch action (e.g. FailedProcessing)
        - performed action (enum type, "delete" or "restart")
        - array of successfully handeled ids
        - array of skipped ids
      ### V1.2.1
      - added `GET /processings/count` with same filtering as `GET /processings`
      - added `GET /failedProcessings/count`
      ### V1.3.0
      - fixed typos in comments
      - added methods to handle downlink session (list, delete and process by AIO processor)
      - added methods to handle datatakes (list and process by L0ASP processor)
      - added methods to handle L0 slices (list and process by L1/L2 processors)
      - added concept of tags
      - changed "requestBody" format from `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json` for all API methods
      - added `GET /products` and `GET /products/count` to list and count products
      - added `PUT /products/{filename}/retention` to handle product retention (data lifecycle)
      - added `PUT /products/{filename}/freeze` to handle quick freeze of product (data lifecycle)
      - fixed missing return objects for restart on failed jobs
      ### V1.4.0
      - removed all methods which are not implemented yet and will probably look different in the future:
        - removed methods to handle downlink session (list, delete and process by AIO processor) as it is not needed and not implemented yet
        - removed methods to handle datatakes (list and process by L0ASP processor) as it is not needed and not implemented yet
        - removed methods to handle L0 slices (list and process by L1/L2 processors) as it is not needed and not implemented yet
        - removed methods to handle products as it is not implemented yet
      - added resubmit endpoint for events
      - added reevaluate endpoint for jobs
      - added schemas for different DTO objects of prodcessings and failed processings
      
      ## Usage Notes
      
      ### API security
      The API is protected by a API key. This is a token (string) agreed by server an client and used to authenticate the client. The client needs to provide the (configurable) API key on every request as a HTTP-Header attribute, e.g. `ApiKey: <yourApiKey>`. The server validates the key send by the client and only allows access if the key is known to the server, else a HTTP error 403 is raised.
      
      ### View and manage failed processings 
      To get a list of failed processings call `GET /failedProcessings`. It will return a list of all failed processings. Operators can review the entries and either restart the processing by `POST /failedProcessings/{id}/restart` or delete a failed processing by `DELETE /failedProcessings/{id}`. In both cases the failed processing is no longer present in the list of failed processings. In case of a restart a failed processing is issued again to the queues eventually resulting in a new processing.
      
      A single failed procesing can be viewed by `GET /failedProcessings/{id}`.
      
      Batch delete can be performed by `POST /failedProcessings/delete`.
      
      Batch restart can be performed by `POST /failedProcessings/restart`.
      
      ### View ongoing processings
      To get a list of processings call `GET /processings`. It will return a list of all processings. As the list might get long, paging can be used to limit the number of results returned. Also filtering is possible by providing additional parameters to filter on ProcessingType and status.
      
      To get the *waiting* processings filter by status=READ e.g. `GET /processings?processingType=t-pdgs-auxiliary-files&processingStatus=READ&pageSize=25&pageNumber=0`.
      
      To get the *running* processings filter by status=SEND e.g. `GET /processings?processingType=t-pdgs-auxiliary-files&processingStatus=SEND&pageSize=25&pageNumber=0`.
      
      A single procesing can be viewed by `GET /processings/{id}`.
      
      A list of supported `ProcessingType` is available at `GET /processingTypes`
      
      ### Validate Metadata Catalog vs Object Storage content
      S1PRO stores metadata of products in a Metadata Catalog and binary files in Object Storage (OBS). Due to issues both storages might get inconsistent, e.g. entries in catalog exists but not in OBS or the otherway round. To validate both storages are consistent, call `POST /validate`.
      
      ## Pattern matching in queries
      Some query parameter support wildcard pattern to search for strings.
      This API supports the following wildcard operators in such patterns
      - `?`, which matches any single character
      - `*`, which can match zero or more characters, including an empty one
      
      **Avoid beginning patterns with `*` or `?`. This can increase the iterations needed to find matching terms and slow search performance.**
      
      ### Examples
      Under the assumption of a data base of the following downlink sessions
      - L20191003131632675001058 (A)
      - S1A__MTI__________030165 (B)
      - S1B__MTI__________019181 (C)
      - L20191003131632675001057 (D)
      - S1A__MPS__________030158 (E)
      
      ## Tags
      S1PRO supports the concept of tags. Some dedicated workflows like re-processing might cause objects like products to be flaged with a tag to indicate the special-case. In a similar way, e.g. a re-transfer of downlink sessions might cause a tag like "retransfer" or similar.
      This concept is very generic and is not designed to be used by algorithms but only as hints to humans as tag-spelling might change without notice while a human is still able to understand the semantic.
      
      To get a list of well-known and supported tags, call `GET /tags`.
      
      Tags can be used to filter. To allow flexibility, the assumption is, that operators "knows" the tag or tag-pattern to search for, so tags are not selected from a predifined list.

      summary: Trigger validation for inconsistency between Catalog and OBS for all products ingested in the time interval 'now-X' and 'now-Y' where X and Y are configurable. The algorithm is basically to search for all products ingested in the time frame in catalog and all files stored in the time frame in the OBS and compare both lists. Any entry only found in one of the lists is double-checked for existence in the other storage and if it's rearlly missing, it is reported via S1PRO-REPORT-API.
