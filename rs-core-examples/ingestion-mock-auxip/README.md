# RS Core - Ingestion Mock AUXIP

This directory contains a special chain that is using an EDIP to simulate an AUXIP for ingestion. Thus similiar to the AUXIP chain an uncompression action is performed after the worker retrieved the products from the EDIP.

This example is used for debugging purposes and is not an operational scenario.

For further documentation and usage instructions, please consult the original [RS Core component](/processing-common/ingestion).
