# RS Core - Ingestion XBIP example

This directories contains the example of an ingestion chain that is configured to operate against an XBIP endpoint. This component is identical to the factory default Ingestion Core component with a more specific configuration for polling multiple XBIP endpoints.

The mocks used for the XBIP can be found [here](https://github.com/COPRS/production-common/tree/develop/rs-testing)
