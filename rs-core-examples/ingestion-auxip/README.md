# RS Core - Ingestion AUXIP

This directories contains the example of an ingestion chain that is configured to operate against an AUXIP endpoint. The AUXIP is an OData based interface and no mock exist. Thus an instance for the S1PDGS had been used. 

For further documentation and usage instructions, please consult the original [RS Core component](/processing-common/ingestion).
