## Deployer properties

The following table only contains a few properties used by the factory default configuration. For more information please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-kubernetes-deployer) or COPRS-ICD-ADST-001139201 - ICD RS core.
  
| Property | Details |
|-|-|
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.namespace` | Namespace to use | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.livenessProbeDelay` | Delay in seconds when the Kubernetes liveness check of the app container should start checking its health status. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.livenessProbePeriod` | Period in seconds for performing the Kubernetes liveness check of the app container. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.livenessProbeTimeout` | Timeout in seconds for the Kubernetes liveness check of the app container. If the health check takes longer than this value to return it is assumed as 'unavailable'. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.livenessProbePath` | Path that app container has to respond to for liveness check. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.livenessProbePort` | Port that app container has to respond on for liveness check. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.readinessProbeDelay` | Delay in seconds when the readiness check of the app container should start checking if the module is fully up and running. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.readinessProbePeriod` | Period in seconds to perform the readiness check of the app container. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.readinessProbeTimeout` | Timeout in seconds that the app container has to respond to its health status during the readiness check. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.readinessProbePath` | Path that app container has to respond to for readiness check. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.readinessProbePort` | Port that app container has to respond on for readiness check. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.limits.memory` | The memory limit, maximum needed value to allocate a pod, Default unit is mebibytes, 'M' and 'G" suffixes supported | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.limits.cpu` | The CPU limit, maximum needed value to allocate a pod | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.requests.memory` | The memory request, guaranteed needed value to allocate a pod. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.requests.cpu` | The CPU request, guaranteed needed value to allocate a pod. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.maxTerminatedErrorRestarts` | Maximum allowed restarts for app that fails due to an error or excessive resource use. | 
| `deployer.<application-name>.kubernetes.environmentVariables` | Can be used to pass additional environmental variables into the application.<br> This can be used for example to set JVM specific arguments to use 512m. The example given shows how the XMX argument can be set: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xmx512m <br> For further information, please consult [this](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_environment_variables) page. |
